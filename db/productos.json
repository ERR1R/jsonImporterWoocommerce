Very well, in fact. So well that he can keep them from attacking other Autobots who accidentally fall into their enclosure, if you follow me. He could, theoretically, ride a motorcycle through the jungle whilst having his Dinobots run along side him, if you catch my drift. Surely not without fear of said Dinobots pouncing on him, you say? Just so, say I! Let's all just hope that there are no genetically engineered Dinobot hybrids about, or Optimus might lose his Alpha status, if you see where I'm going with this. No? Alright then, this WOAH Dino Transformers Shirt references the scene in Jurassic World where Owen (played by Chris Pratt) keeps his well trained raptors from attacking a worker who had fallen into their enclosure. I'm surprised you didn't see that coming, it's really a quite popular meme.","articulos":[{"precio":27.02,"descuento":10,"impuesto":13,"existencias":10,"config":{"talla":"S"}},{"precio":27.02,"descuento":10,"impuesto":13,"existencias":1,"config":{"talla":"M"}},{"precio":27.02,"descuento":0,"impuesto":13,"existencias":2,"config":{"talla":"L"}}]},{"sku":"TRAN162","categorias":["Transformers","Cartoon"],"titulo":"Transformers Grimlock Shirt ","url":"transformers-grimlock-shirt","pics":["https:\/\/80stees.imgix.net\/s\/files\/1\/0384\/0921\/products\/transformers-grimlock-shirt.v3.dsk.jpeg?v=1486393884&usm=18&auto=format&fit=max&h=710&w=463&"],"desc":"This Transformers shirt features an image of Grimlock and a quote from the 1986 animated movie, \"Me Grimlock No Like You\".
